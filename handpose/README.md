# 🎅 MerryCam 🎄

With MerryCam, your webcam feed transforms into a holiday wonderland. Your **fingers become magic wands** that let you decorate your screen with festive vibes. 🎉  

<br>

## ✨ Concept

**Experience the magic of Christmas—one fingertip at a time!**

- Hold up your **fingers to draw a rectangle** in front of the camera, and watch as it fills with holiday magic! Inside your "Christmas zone," colors transform into reds and greens, like you’re peeking into a holiday ornament. 🎄
- **Emoji snowstorm** – be Santa for a moment! Holiday emojis like snowflakes, Santas, and trees shower over your face, adding a playful disguise. “Who’s Santa?” The mystery is all yours! 😎  
<br>

## 🎅 How to Use

1. **Turn on your webcam** and run the program.
2. **Draw a rectangle with your fingers** on the screen to create a “Christmas zone.”!  

<br>

## 🎄 Christmas Starts!

Spread Christmas cheer with a flick of your fingers—Let it snow! Let it glow! 🎶  <br>
