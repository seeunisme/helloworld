# Box Throwing Game 🎯

Welcome to the **Box Throwing Game**, where your goal is to throw boxes and hit the target boxes! Simple, right? 
Well, there’s a catch—you’re supposed to throw the boxes from *inside* the magical circle. Why? Because that's the *unwritten rule* of the game, of course! 😄 But don't worry, if you happen to throw a box from outside the circle, the game won’t stop you… It’ll just silently judge you..

## About the Game

In this game, you’ll:
- **Start by creating a box** within the central circle and **drag it to throw it** towards randomly generated target boxes.
- **Score points** by hitting the target boxes.
- **Miss the target?** Well, then your score resets, and you'll have to start again. Try to set a high score!

## How It Works

- This game was built using the [p5.play library](https://p5play.org) for p5.js, which makes it super easy to create sprites and handle collisions.
- I started with a [starter code](https://editor.p5js.org/quinton-ashley/sketches/szN_XdV5O) and added my own spin on it.

## Work in Progress 🛠️

I’m currently working on an *upgraded* version where instead of boxes, throwing **food emojis** 🍎🍇🍔🍟🍕🍖🥐..
